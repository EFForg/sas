The Stand Against Spying methodology has been updated! Recently, Senator Leahy introduced a new version of the USA FREEDOM Act ([S. 2685](https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2685)). This bill is less comprehensive than the original version of the bill, but it does several important things:

1.	It creates a panel of special advocates to argue for civil liberties in the FISA court.
2.	It limits bulk collection of domestic call detail records
3.	It adds new levels of transparency to the NSA surveillance programs.

However, the bill still has shortcomings. The bill will extend the sunset on a controversial section of the Patriot Act by 2 years, it fails to end mass surveillance of Internet communications under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, it does not adequately protect the rights of people outside the United States, and the language remains vulnerable to aggressive legal arguments in the FISA court and elsewhere.

Nonetheless, this bill is a step towards comprehensive reform and we want to recognize the legislators working to move the conversation forward in DC. We are thus awarding members of Congress 4 points for co-sponsoring this version of the USA FREEDOM Act. This should not be seen as an endorsement of the bill by every member in the coalition.
