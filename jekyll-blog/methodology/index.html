        <h2>Our methodology</h2>
          <p>Our methodology is designed to recognize those members of Congress who have taken objective, measurable steps to enacting meaningful surveillance reform, while also surfacing for the public those members of Congress who have not been engaged in the fight or who have promoted bills that would entrench mass surveillance. </p>
          <p>We did not consider any statements made by any members of Congress. We did not look at position papers. We did not look at sign-on letters. We only considered whether a member of Congress co-sponsored a bill and his or her voting history. These two factors truly represent where a member of Congress stands when it comes to surveillance reform. They are more important than any statement an elected official can make. Voting history and co-sponsorships are objective, verifiable, and they are where the rubber meets the road for protecting privacy. </p>
          <p>There have been a variety of bills introduced since the Snowden revelations, but not every bill goes far enough toward promoting meaningful reform. We gave credit to members of Congress who co-sponsored the two strongest bills, the Surveillance State Repeal Act and the original version of the USA FREEDOM Act. Both bills attempt to address multiple facets of the surveillance problem, including mass data collection, oversight, and transparency. While imperfect, both bills would be a strong step forward for civil liberties.</p>
          <p>We also gave points to members of Congress who voted for amendments to the defense appropriations bill that sought to rein in mass spying. Two highly publicized votes--the Conyers-Amash amendment of 2013 and the Massie-Lofgren amendment of 2014--each sough to tackle major issues with mass spying. The Conyers-Lofgren amendment, in particular, sought to curtail funding for mass surveillance.</p>
          <p>We also recognized co-sponsorships for two important bills, the FISA Court Reform Act and the Surveillance Transparency Act of 2013.  While neither bill would end mass spying, each would bring important new levels of transparency to surveillance. Transparency is necessary to prevent surveillance abuses, can give the public more insight into surveillance, and can be a stepping-stone for additional reforms.</p>
          <p>In some cases, we penalized members of Congress for promoting bills that would entrench mass spying.  In particular, we awarded negative points for co-sponsorships of the FISA Improvements Act of 2013 and the FISA Transparency and Modernization Act, both of which offer modest transparency benefits while attempting to codifying mass surveillance into law. </p>
          <p>In addition, we award negative points for voting for the USA FREEDOM Act that passed out of the House of Representatives. This bill was so altered by the time it went to the floor for a vote that the overwhelming majority of civil liberties groups that had previously praised the bill withdrew their support, and many of its original co-sponsors also chose to vote against the bill. This version of the USA FREEDOM Act not only failed to address the problems with mass spying, it extended the sunsets on key provisions of the PATRIOT Act until 2017 (instead of 2015), making it a net negative for the public.</p>
          <p>In addition, we thought it was important to note the history, which has led to the current surveillance problems we are facing today. We wanted to factor in the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendment Act. We chose to assess the reauthorization of each, both because those reauthorizations are the reason the most controversial surveillance practices are still in place and because the reauthorizations happened years after the original bills were enacted, giving members of Congress ample time to fully understand how these surveillance authorities were being abused. While we wanted to include these reauthorizations, we weighed them relatively little. After all, it is current action from Congress, rather than historical action, which is most important to ending mass spying and should weigh most in our scorecard.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have given significant consideration to those members of Congress who have not been involved in this debate--have not co-sponsored any legislation or voted for any legislation. This is often the case with Senators, who have not yet had the opportunity to vote on a bill. Ultimately, we decided that these individuals should get 0 points, an F. Now is the time for members of Congress to be representing their constituents and working to stop the mass surveillance.  Sitting the debate out is not acceptable. </p>
          <p>It should be noted that every Senator can and should be co-sponsoring the USA FREEDOM Act, and so all of them can and should get good scores in our scorecard.  We encourage Senators to add their names to the list of co-sponsors for USA FREEDOM, so we can publicly recognize their efforts to defend privacy.  </p>
